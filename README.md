# VIM Driver for Docker

This Vim Driver is able together with the [Docker VNFM](https://github.com/openbaton/go-docker-vnfm) to deploy NS on top of a Docker engine.

Both VNFM and VIM Driver are necessary in order to be able to deploy NS over Docker   

# How to install the Docker VIM Driver

## Requirements

- go compiler (https://golang.org/dl/)
- dep (https://github.com/golang/dep)

## Build the Docker VIM Driver

Assuming that your `GOPATH` variable is set to $HOME/go (find out typing `go env`), run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/openbaton
cd ~/go/src/github.com/openbaton
git clone git@github.com:openbaton/go-docker-driver.git
cd go-docker-driver
dep ensure
cd main
go build -o docker-driver
```

Afterwards check the usage by running:

```bash
./docker-driver --help
```

# How to start the Docker VIM Driver

If you don't need special configuration, start the docker-driver just by running:

```bash
./docker-driver
```

# How to use the Docker VIM Driver

In order to upload a VimInstance using the docker driver, you need to upload a Vim Instance as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "vim-instance",
  "authUrl": "unix:///var/run/docker.sock",
  "tenant": "1.32",
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "openbaton",
  "type": "docker",
  "location": {
    "name": "Berlin",
    "latitude": "52.525876",
    "longitude": "13.314400"
  }
}
```

* **authUrl** either you pass the unix socket, in this case will use the socket running locally to the vim driver or the host connection string for remote execution
* **tenant** in the tenant you can specify the api version used by the chosen docker engine
* **type** is docker

after uploading this Vim Instance, you should be able to see all images and networks in the PoP page of the NFVO dashbaord

# What is Open Baton?

OpenBaton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification.

Open Baton is a ETSI NFV MANO compliant framework. Open Baton was part of the OpenSDNCore (www.opensdncore.org) project started almost three years ago by Fraunhofer FOKUS with the objective of providing a compliant implementation of the ETSI NFV specification.

Open Baton is easily extensible. It integrates with OpenStack, and provides a plugin mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It supports Network Service management either using a generic VNFM or interoperating with VNF-specific VNFM. It uses different mechanisms (REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with the VNFMs. It integrates with additional components for the runtime management of a Network Service. For instance, it provides autoscaling and fault management based on monitoring information coming from the the monitoring system available at the NFVI level.
