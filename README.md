# Test plugin for Vim Driver interface
This plugin imitates the behaviour of a real vim-driver plugin and offers in this way the possibility to test the NFVO without an actual VIM (for instance Openstack). 

It works with [dummy][dummy-vnfm-amqp] implementations of the VNFM. 

# How to install the Test plugin

If you follow the documentation and use the bootstrap script to install Open Baton the Test plugin will already be present.

If you installed Open Baton from source code and cloned the git repositories to your computer you will have to add the Test plugin to the NFVO by hand. 
It is recommended to download the stable version of the plugin from [here][get-openbaton-org] and copy it into the folder *{nfvoRootDir}/plugins/vim-drivers*. 
Afterwards you will have to restart the NFVO.  
Alternatively you can build it by yourself by cloning the Test plugin's git repository, changing into the projects root directory and 
executing 

```bash
  ./gradlew build
```

Afterwards you will find the jar file in the folder *build/libs*.  
Copy it into the folder *{nfvoRootDir}/plugins/vim-drivers* and restart the NFVO.

# How to use the Test plugin

To use the Test plugin you have to register a Vim Instance with the *type* field set to value *test* and use this Vim Instance for deploying your network service. 
Additionally you should use a [dummy][dummy-vnfm-amqp] implementation of a VNFM.

# What is Open Baton?

OpenBaton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification.

Open Baton is a ETSI NFV MANO compliant framework. Open Baton was part of the OpenSDNCore (www.opensdncore.org) project started almost three years ago by Fraunhofer FOKUS with the objective of providing a compliant implementation of the ETSI NFV specification. 

Open Baton is easily extensible. It integrates with OpenStack, and provides a plugin mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It supports Network Service management either using a generic VNFM or interoperating with VNF-specific VNFM. It uses different mechanisms (REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with the VNFMs. It integrates with additional components for the runtime management of a Network Service. For instance, it provides autoscaling and fault management based on monitoring information coming from the the monitoring system available at the NFVI level.
